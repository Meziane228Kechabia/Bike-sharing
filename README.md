# NYC Citi Bike
My analysis on the NYC Citi Bike.

# Overview of Project
	The data provided to me in one file, represent a raw information of NYC Citi Bike 

# Purpose
To help Kate to simply understand the provided data and giving her elements to make the right decision on opening a Citi Bike in Des Moines, Ohio.
# Analysis and Challenges
Many Tableau functions did not work well when trying to make new worksheets until I have updated my material version.

# Summary
I do not have access to see where exactly Kate wants to implant her new shop, and she should check for the following:

•	Gather data bus transport efficiency rate.
•	Gather data on traffic rate.
•	Get another visualization for start station by gender.
•	Get another visualization for trips by weekday by hour and by gender.
